PKI-Based 2FA Microservice with Docker
Secure authentication microservice implementing RSA encryption, TOTP-based 2FA, and persistent storage using Docker.

Features
RSA/OAEP Encryption: 4096-bit RSA key pair for secure seed transmission
TOTP Authentication: Time-based One-Time Password generation and verification
REST API: Three endpoints for seed decryption, 2FA generation, and verification
Persistent Storage: Docker volumes for data persistence across restarts
Cron Integration: Automated 2FA code logging every minute
Multi-Stage Docker Build: Optimized container image with minimal size
Setup

Clone the repository

Generate RSA keys: python generate_keys.py

Request encrypted seed from instructor API

Build and run: docker-compose up --build

API Endpoints
POST /decrypt-seed - Decrypt encrypted seed
GET /generate-2fa - Generate current 2FA code
POST /verify-2fa - Verify 2FA code
